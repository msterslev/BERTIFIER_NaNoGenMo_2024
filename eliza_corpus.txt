I'm not sure I understand you fully.
Please go on.
What does that suggest to you?
Please don't apologize.
Does thinking of that bring anything else to mind?
What else do you recollect?
What is the connection between me and you?
Do you think its likely?
Have you ever dreamed before?
Do you dream often?
Do you believe that dreams have something to do with your problems?
You don't seem quite certain.
I've told you before, I don't care about names.
Do computers worry you?
Why do you mention computers?
What do you think machines have to do with your problem?
Don't you think computers can help people?
What about machines worrys you?
What do you think about machines?
Would you want to be?
Do you wish I would tell you what you are?
I don't understand that.
Perhaps I am in your fantasies.
What does that suggest to you?
Why do you tell me that now?
Perhaps I already know.
Would you like to believe?
What do you think?
I am sorry to hear that you are.
Do you think that coming here will help you?
I'm sure it's not pleasant to be.
Can you explain?
Do you really think so?
But you are not sure.
Do you really doubt yourself?
Is it because you are doubtful that you came to me?
Have you tried?
Perhaps you could.
Why don't you?
Does that trouble you?
Tell me more about such feelings.
Perhaps in your fantasies we are each other.
Do you wish to were me?
You seem to need to be me.
Can you elaborate on that?
That's quite interesting.
What are your feelings now?
You seem to be quite positive.
You are sure.
I see.
I understand.
Are you thinking of a very special person?
Can you think of a specific example?
When?
What incident are you thinking of?
In what way?
What resemblance do you see?
What does that similarity suggest to you?
What other connections do you see?
What do you suppose that resemblance means?
What is the connection, do you suppose?
Could here really be some connection?
How?
